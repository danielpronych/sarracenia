-------

TO COMPLETE : In addition to *thneed* work. other small things.

ALREADY FIXED !!!: =================

> \- fix: force-polling broken since recent libsrshim work. -- delete
> support to sr\_Watch in polling mode (already in sr\_cpost.)

### Remove:

> -   DONE
>
>     remove 'filename' in msg.headers \*\*\* impacts people used to
>     topic exp and topic v00 remove 'flow' option and in msg.headers
>     remove 'recursive' and set it to True when applicable
>
> -   AS DISCUSSED... *rename* kept sr\_watch users using -skip force
>     headers\[rename\] to stripped relpath
>
>     *rename* functionality should be removed, as it is not used in
>     practice. there was rename has a message header, and rename as an
>     additional field on messages. both should be removed. Should we
>     iterate the version of version2 protocol?

Addition: ========

> -   DONE

>     > :   if not options go through the extend mechanism
>     >
>     > -- variable definition for plugins. A way to declare variables to avoid the 'unknown setting' error message.

additional *actions* component x:

    start|stop            if no configs specified, then start all of x


    sr_subscribe add new.conf  mine.inc
            -> copies new.conf & mine.inc -> ~/.config/sarra/subscribe/new.conf


    add/remove        Add a config file by copying it from wherever to the right place.

    edit                     call up $EDITOR on the config file.

          default     -- edits default.conf
          credentials -- edits credentials.conf
          admin       -- edits admin.conf

          admin.conf should be automagically sourced, like default.conf by sr_audit.
          don't think anyone else should use it.
          likely *declare* *admin* *feeder* stuff should go there rather than default.conf.


    log                      exec tail -f of the log file of the config file...
                            if instances >1  warn monitoring is easier with sr_report.
                            if an instance is specified, then tail -f of that instance's log

    list                      list all the files in the component's config directory.
       sr_subscribe
                new (enabled) instances: 5
         includes:
                 mine.inc
    enable/disable     rename config file from .conf to .off
                       if disable and running... warn and dont do
