sr\_Sarracenia Design Docs
==========================

Please note the nature of Design documents is that they do not reflect
the actual implementation. Some of it is ideas that were discarded, much
of it is the basis for discussion. When the design is settled and
decisions made, the information percolates down into the documentation
(outside this directory.) So the information here is of some interest to
developers and contributors, but not really useful to anyone else.

Current information:

> -   [Outline.html](Outline.html)
> -   [design.html](design.html)
> -   [plan.html](plan.html)
> -   [biblio.html](biblio.html) -- bibliography.

The rest are just notes which are likely out of date:

> -   [accounts.html](accounts.html)
> -   [components.html](components.html) some initial guesses of
>     necessary components.
> -   [configuration.html](configuration.html)
> -   [deltas.html](deltas.html) Implementation supercedes this.
> -   [sr\_post\_sample.html](sr_post_sample.html) This is what the
>     initial implementation was based on.
> -   [message\_considerations.html](message_considerations.html)
>     Implementation supercedes this.
> -   [messages\_v02.html](messages_v02.html) superceded by sr\_post.7
> -   [monitoring.html](monitoring.html)
> -   [packaging.html](packaging.html)
> -   [private.html](private.html)
> -   [scope.html](scope.html) the background information that evolved
>     into to\_cluster
> -   [validation.html](validation.html) early implementation in
>     sr\_sarra... more to come.
> -   [webification.html](webification.html) pipe dream downstream...
