Goals for Next Release August 2017
==================================

Date just indicates start of work. Release date likely in September.
General target: make it easier for users to deploy their own flows.

Target Use Cases
================

*Drop Box* - bi-directional directory synchronization betwen Science and
EC using HPFX as a broker. On science an sr\_watches to sci2ec exchange,
an sr\_subscribe to pull data from Science. An sr\_watch posting to
ec2sci, and have a sender pushing the data back.

*Dissemination* - same pattern on science, but a sarra on EC, instead of
the subscribe, and a sender to send it further, perhaps via collab.

Specific Small Changes
======================

Feedback from a few small attempts to implement user based flows:

> -   remove the file names from topic.
> -   add *events* to consumers. Sr\_subscribe *-events modify*. will
>     not consume/reflect symlinks, or file deletions. In message
>     processing code, will reject before applying accept/reject.
> -   also support events in post... (figure out how to post a file that
>     doesn't exist as a remove?)
> -   make multi-switch broker stuff default to *working* without
>     settings (*gateway for*, *cluster*, etc...)
> -   *to* should default to the broker hostname, at least. ( like
>     sr\_cpost. )
> -   SFTP should work using openSSH's credential files (already in
>     paramiko.) just need to suppress the validation in sarra.
> -   Sarra should work exactly like subscribe, but just add posting at
>     the end. so *directory* should do the right thing. Currently, it
>     seems to ignore that. sarra post\_document\_root/directory stuff.
>     (will only find files if you specify a post\_documentroot, but
>     then it refuses to post the whole path, because of
>     post\_documentroot.) sarra - posting file: url's. standard use
>     case for mortals. (get around it by sr\_sender using *directory*,
>     but relatively ugly.)
>
>     one approach:
>
>         sr_subscribe could accept post_document_root to set the directory initially...
>         post_document_root provides default if no directory specified (so old sarra configs need no mod.)
>         or say 
>
> -   review all usage strings, to make them accurate (all are out of
>     date.)
> -   bring cache in everywhere, so it works in an understandable
>     manner. subscribers also, see C implementation as reference. have
>     python work with C cache files.
> -   require configuration to be named?
> -   sr\_x status --\> show all known configs of x ?
> -   have sr\_post work like cpost, with *sleep* to become a *watch*
> -   have heartbeat default print some stats: bytes downloads, msg.
>     downloaded, rates during interval between hearbeats: bytes &
>     messages per second.
> -   Add user defined headers '-headers printer=cidulas '
> -   headers received and not understood should pass through unmodified
>     (upward compatibility.)
> -   sr start --\> should look at post/ subdir for confiugurations
>     where sleep \> 0, and start those.

Thneed
======

This is for discussion, not execution...

So Michel has been talking for a while about coalescing everything into
one component. so we can have a new config file format that is init-like
with sections. The different common requirements have the same names in
the different sections. We have one binary... sarracenia? and itÂ´s
config looks like:

    [ list ]

    do consume_queue|poll_server|scan_path 

    """
      do arguments? self for the options, return value?
         path name, and stat=None, or msg=None,  (None meaning not available.)
         or just a partial message is always constructed?
    """
    broker amqps:...
    subtopic  h.b.c.#

    sum 
    parts 

    """
      I don't know where these go, do they get used here, or only in filter?

    """
    etc...

    [ filter ]

    reject .*grib.*
    accept .*

    cache on

    """
      applies filtering based on path name (perhaps extend to other attributes.)

    """
    do == on_message

    [ process ]

    do download|send|off

    on_part, on_file hmm...

    [ post ]

    do == on_post
    broker


    [ report ]
    do == on_post
    broker
    topic_prefix

unresolved questions:

:   -   what is the API of the *do* plugins? for list, every call to
        *do* returns a path name & optional statbuf and or message?
        (None if NA)
    -   syntax changes considerably, likely need a converter, that
        ingests old config and *updates* to new.
    -   one very long man page at the end of this!
    -   how does command line usage reflect change of *section*, use
        each *section* name as a keyword?
    -   sr\_subscribe becomes: sarracenia -get -method subscribe
        -process -method download
    -   just place these files in \~/.config/sarra/\<config\> (not
        component location.)
    -   because the syntax to access options will change. All of the
        plugins also need to be updated. (API change.) + and make the
        old work with the new during transition.

Advantages:

:   -   single component for whole application (except start\|stop?)
    -   could all be packed into one big script (like dd\_subscribe
        was.)
    -   less concepts, less repetition, less code. just one algorithm
        with settings.

If we undertake such a change, one thing is clear: Need something that
read the old files and spits out the new ones (mass converter.)

ConfigParser
============

I imagine one goal of changing config file format is to reduce less code
by using python's configparser modules. But it builds a dict, rather
than a list, which means multiple accept/reject don't work, and throw an
error.

One can try to get around it like so:

    filter= 
      reject .*GIF.*
      reject .*GRIB.*
      accept .*

Placing all the reject/accept clauses in a single value, but then the
question is what to do with *include*. One can make \[include\] a
separate section? (what about nested?) need to get ordering right. so
would put *filter9* in the main file, and then *filter0* in an include
file, and then the parsing logic would use them in order?

What if *include* sets something other than accept/reject... hmm.. so
each include file has \[list\] ... \[filter\] ... \[post\] ...
\[report\] and then are included to each section...

Thneed II
=========

We take all of the above stuff, and we forget about trying to adopt
ConfigParser. we just add to the existing module \[list\], \[filter\],
\[process\], \[post\] and just use that as a textual substition in
config settings. ie. \[list\] broker -\> self.list\_broker so you just
need a few aliases, and everything still works, but it is clearer in the
the config files.

probably a lot less effort to do this, than the above.

Another Version
===============

do consume\_q,filter,download,report

\[consume\_q\] broker exchange ....

Thneed III: use TOML.

most of it is obvious.... but accept/reject would use the array of aray
syntax:

\[\[ filter \]\]

directory "/b" reject ".*haha.*"

\[\[ filter \]\] directory = "/a" accept .*hoho.*

but no obvious way to "include"
