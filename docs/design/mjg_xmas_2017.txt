At end of year, small things left for next one:

- Sr_pitcher  (command line…   gui for fun,   clamav
- Sr_assemble  (… argh !   rewrite)
- Outlet  (testing,   insertion in  file_assemble for parts)
- Sr_transport   (bring  common functionality (file locking ".tmp") there instead of everywhere)
- Pika :  find cause of weird connection lost  (I might be wrong… impression of around 10 mins)
- Windows    edit/log
- Mac os   testing
- Webdav… (had a look at it… seems relatively easy … python package wraps it with http request)
- Heartbeat stats
- Testing against TC  (wrote script without testing/running yet…  just started)
- Analysis of   retry_mode  usage  for  events  (MOVE,DELETE…) 
- Review  help  in programs.
 
Other considerations:
- figuring out 


Summary of Progress During the Fall:

Originally, the plan was to get "reporting" to work properly and be deployed, but we
changed course in September, and got more ambitious.  Michel refactored the code entirely, 
improving it drastically by eliminating almost all code duplication. The command-line arguments 
were reviewed and improved to make them easier to work with. However, this refactoring introduced 
many small regressions that had to be worked through. The refactoring also included enhancements
to address several use cases for the new Service Catalog offerings (Dropbox style exchanges, Per
user file flows.)  We were working on the HPC mirrorring use case throughout the fall, and Michel
handled updates to the python side, while Peter updated the C side.  At the end of the period,
it looked like functionality was taken care of, and the last releases concentrated on
improved recovery from server errors.

By using someone with intimate knowledge of the code, and an excellent working relationship,
the project was advanced by what would have taken several years' worth of development effort if
attempted with other resources.
